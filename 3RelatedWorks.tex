\label{chapter:related}
In this chapter, we discuss related work on texture reconstruction in Section~\ref{related:texture-recon}. We discuss seamless surface parameterization in Section~\ref{related:param} as a classical problem in the geometry processing community. We finally discuss related work on texture understanding,  including semantic understanding from parameterized texture (Section~\ref{related:texturenet}) and canonical frame understanding from 2D images (Section~\ref{related:framenet}).
